### Environment Variables

There are several environment variables that are used to retreive data such as Youtube videos and Tumblr blog posts. When setting up deployments to Now, these environment variables need to be set up on the Now platform.

[Now docs on adding secrets](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/build-step#adding-secrets)

Steps to add environment variables:

1. Install Now either in your project directory or globally.
2. Run this command in your project directory: `now`.
3. You will be prompted to connect your account via email.
4. Add your secret using: `now secrets add <secret-name> <secret-value>`.
5. Create a file callsed `now.json`.
6. Reference the added `<secret-name>` like this `@<secret-name>`. For example:
   ```json
   {
     "build": {
       "env": {
         "YOUTUBE_API_KEY": "@youtube_api_key",
         "YOUTUBE_CHANNEL_ID": "@youtube_channel_id",
         "TUMBLR_API_KEY": "@tumblr_api_key"
       }
     }
   }
   ```
7. You can now reference these environment variables in your `next.config.js` and in your app.
8. While your developing locally, you can just create a `.env` file and reference the environment variables.
